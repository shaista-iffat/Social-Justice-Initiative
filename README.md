# Social-Justice-Initiative
The Barriers for Immigrant Women Scoial Justice Initiative was a muti-part culminating final project.
A google forms survey was availible during a 2 month period & was used to gather data anonymously from students at a Toronto Highschool.
This data was compared to real statistics on a global & Canadian level to address barriers that immigrant women face in Canada.
The project emphasized mental health, socioeconomical, and cultural barriers.
A website ( https://shaistaiffat.wixsite.com/storiesofanimmigrant ) consisting of project information, data collected & compared against published statistics & resourseful links.
An instragram page ( https://www.instagram.com/femigrationsupport/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D ) was created to present infographics, historical events & statistics.
The project concluded with a presentation at a "Young Women's Outreach" seminar at an organization in Toronto.
